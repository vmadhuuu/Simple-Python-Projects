# Simple-Python-Projects
Collection of various simple Python projects which I implemented to further explore Python language.

1. Tkinter Form with SQL: Created a Car Registration Form using Tkinter and created a database to store all the data input by the user each time the form is filled. The user has the ability to view all the current records in the database and he/she can also delete all the records in the database.
